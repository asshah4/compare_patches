# ECG patches

This repository contains code and data for several types of patch data. There will be several projects that extract code from individual patch types. These data will be extracted with the intent to convert them to a MATLAB compatible format for signal processing.

## VivaLNK

## Bittium

This data is stored in EDF format. The Physionet WFDB software allows for _simple_ conversion into other formats (e.g. MATLAB, python, etc). Ideally best stored or save as MAT format for processing.

## Cardea Solo

# Comparison of Patches

The quality of the data will be compared here, both as raw RR intervals as well as processed HRV.
