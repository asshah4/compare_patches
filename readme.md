# ECG patches

< test edits made by Manasvi >

This repository contains code and data for several types of patch data. There will be several projects that extract code from individual patch types. These data will be extracted with the intent to convert them to a MATLAB compatible format for signal processing.

This data is stored in EDF format. The Physionet WFDB software allows for _simple_ conversion into other formats (e.g. MATLAB, python, etc). Ideally best stored or save as MAT format for processing.

# Comparison of Patches

The quality of the data will be compared here, both as raw RR intervals as well as processed HRV. To guide comparison, we should have several measures of differences here:

- how do RR intervals compare between devices?
- how do RR intervals compare when adjusting SQI and capture qualities of RR generation?
- how doe the changes and differences in both the RR quality and the device itself lead to changes in HRV results?
